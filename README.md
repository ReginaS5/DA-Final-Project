# Health Metrics Exploration: Hair Loss
Overview:
This repository contains exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling focusing on various health metrics and their potential correlation with hair loss. The analysis aims to uncover relationships between multiple health indicators and the incidence of hair loss.

## Dataset:
The dataset used for this analysis comprises health-related metrics, including:

Vitamin intake
Stress levels
Protein levels
And other health parameters
Analysis Scope:
The primary objective of this analysis is to explore correlations between the collected health metrics and hair loss. While the primary focus is on hair loss, the analysis provides insights into broader health-related factors that might influence this phenomenon.

## Contents:
Jupyter Notebook: Contains detailed steps of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling.
Data Files: The dataset 'hair_loss.csv' used for the analysis.
Analysis Steps:
Data Cleaning: Checked for missing values and duplicates. No missing values or duplicates were found.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized the distribution of health metrics and identified potential correlations with hair loss.
Predictive Modeling: Trained models to predict hair loss based on health metrics, exploring various algorithms and performance metrics.
Requirements:
Python 3.x
pandas
scikit-learn
seaborn (for visualization)
