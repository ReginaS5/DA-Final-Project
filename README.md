# Challenges of Handling Faulty Datasets
### Overview:
This repository delves into the complexities and solutions encountered when working with imperfect or faulty datasets. The analysis explores the intricacies of managing and extracting insights from data prone to inconsistencies, errors, or pre-processing issues.

### Dataset:
The dataset used in this analysis is simulated, intentionally designed to mirror common issues found in real-world datasets:

Artificially introduced inconsistencies
Standardized and scaled data causing unforeseen impacts on analyses
Potentially missing or erroneous entries
### Analysis Focus:
##### The primary emphasis of this analysis is on:

Identifying challenges posed by the faulty dataset
Implementing strategies to mitigate these challenges
Demonstrating adaptability and problem-solving in data analysis amidst imperfect datasets

### Contents:
Jupyter Notebook: Contains detailed documentation of encountered issues, exploratory strategies, and solutions applied to handle the faulty dataset.
Data Files: The provided dataset 'faulty_data.csv' highlighting simulated issues.
Analysis Highlights:
Identifying Data Issues: Discusses the various issues present in the dataset and their potential impact on analyses.
Strategies for Handling Faults: Outlines approaches used to address inconsistencies, scale-related problems, or missing data.
Revised Analysis: Demonstrates the adapted analyses or models after applying strategies to manage the faulty dataset.

### Requirements:
Python 3.x
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib, seaborn (for visualization)
